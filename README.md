# CardGame
#This was my first project during learning Java, and some OOD. Still there is no GUI only command line game. 
#I've only made the logical side of this game, and left it.

Idea is a logical Card game, inspired on Triple Triad minigame from FinalFantasy IIX. 
In the game two players face off against one another, one side playing as "X", the other as "O" on a 3x3 grid. 
Each player has cards in a hand and the aim is to capture the opponent's cards by turning them into the player's own color of X or O.
